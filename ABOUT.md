# Timetabling System (TtS)

The Timetabling System (TtS) is a pioneering initiative by the Advanced Informatics Department within the Faculty of Technology and Informatics (FTIR). This computerized control system was developed to efficiently allocate venues for every course within the department. With a limited number of venues available, TtS plays a crucial role in streamlining the allocation process. It empowers office assistants to effortlessly generate timetables for all courses across various programs within AID and provides lecturers with easy access to class venue information for the courses they teach.

## Key Objectives

- **Efficient Venue Allocation**: TtS ensures that the available venues are optimally assigned to each course, minimizing scheduling conflicts and maximizing resource utilization.

- **Streamlined Timetable Generation**: The system simplifies the complex task of creating timetables for all courses under each program within the Advanced Informatics Department.

- **Enhanced Transparency**: Lecturers gain access to comprehensive class venue information, allowing them to focus on delivering quality education.

## Use Cases

TtS encompasses a total of 12 key use cases, each contributing to the system's functionality and usability. These use cases are visually represented in the figure below:
